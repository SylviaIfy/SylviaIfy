### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sylvia Ofiani.

I'm an excellent Quality Assurance Engineer who loves learning and trying new things.

This year, 2024, I'm letting the learning bug take me on an extended journey where I learn more about software development and test automation: Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Selenium, Appium ....

I'm curious to see where the learning bug will take me after these, I'll be back to update this file with details of my journey, maybe I might share some funny experiences as well.

Cheers.
