### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sylvia Ofiani.

I'm an excellent Quality Assurance Engineer.

I love learning and trying new things.

This year, 2024, I'm letting the learning bug take me on an extended journey where I learn about software development and test automation: Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Selenium, ....

I'll be back to update this file with details of my journey with the learning bug.

Cheers.
